# TODO: Add Background Image to Login Page

- [x] Update frontend/src/pages/Login.jsx to add background image styling to the outer div using inline styles with a sample finance-themed image URL, ensuring it covers the screen and positions centrally.
- [x] Remove background image from frontend/src/pages/Profile.jsx to revert to original styling.
